- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emmon Howlader

I'm a computer engineer specialising in web application development, Deep Learning & Machine Learning research. My primary goal is to use my expertise to create unique work. In addition, I am a full-time learner who enjoys exposure to new technology. On the other side, I am a traveller who enjoys life to the fullest. Reading literature and playing chess are two of my favourite pastimes. My favourite hobbies are swimming, sketching, cooking, and gardening.
